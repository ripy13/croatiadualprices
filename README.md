# Croatia dual prices

Displays dual prices in WordPress/WooCommerce.

Exchange rate: 1 EUR = 7.53450 HRK


In Croatia, the euro will be introduced as the official currency from January 1, 2023. 
In July 2022., the Council of the European Union adopted a decision regulating the adoption of the EURO in the Republic of Croatia and a fixed exchange rate for the conversion of kuna to EURO (1 EUR = HRK 7.53450). 
From September 5, 2022 until the end of 2023, prices will be displayed dually - in kuna and in euros.
Payment is still exclusively in kuna until the end of 2022, regardless of the dual display of prices.
